Detailed Overview:
Class-Level :
This provides a general explanation of the approach taken by the method, including the complexity and the key aspects of
 he implementation.
Method-Level :
The method description includes details on the dynamic programming approach, specifically mentioning the use of tabulation
 (bottom-up method). It explains the time and space complexity, which is crucial for understanding the efficiency of the algorithm.
Parameter Descriptions:
Each parameter (amount, coins, denominations) is explained, giving insight into their roles in the method.
Exception Handling:
The throws clause in the JavaDoc specifies the InsufficientCoinsException, which provides clarity on when and why this
 exception might be thrown.
Detailed Inline :
Inline comments within the method provide a step-by-step explanation of the logic, including the initialization of the
 buttomUp array, the role of the coinInventory map, the update mechanism for buttomUp and coinCount, and the final backtracking step.
